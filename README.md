### Due to the way GitHub pages is set up for user pages, this project has been split into 4 branches:

## master
Since this is a user page, GitHub pages must be deployed in the master branch. As such, developmental work was hard to manage on this branch, so I switched over to working in **dev** as my "master" branch. This branch now has all the minified content needed to properly deploy this on [abhiek187.github.io](https://abhiek187.github.io).

## dev
This is where all developmental work takes place. Select this branch for more info about my website, how to contribute, etc.

## backup
A backup branch in case something goes wrong in dev (i.e. trying to migrate all files away from master).

## gh-pages
Normally, this would be the branch GitHub pages would deploy your site in, but because this is a user page, it doesn't do anything. Instead, think of this as a backup for master.
